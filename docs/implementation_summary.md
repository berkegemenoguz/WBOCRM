**Project:** Web-Based Operational CRM  
**Course:** Istanbul Arel University – HW5 Part 2  
**Date:** May 2026

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1 – Project Setup
- Monorepo structure: `backend/` (Node.js) and `frontend/` (React/Vite)
- Git repository initialised, `.gitignore` configured
- `backend/package.json` with all production and dev dependencies
- `frontend/package.json` with React, React Router, Axios, Vite

### Phase 2 – Database Layer
- PostgreSQL schema in `backend/src/db/schema.sql`
- Tables: `UserAccount`, `Lead`, `InteractionLog`, `SupportTicket`
- `pool.js` with SSL auto-detection for Render deployment
- `init.js` (schema creation) and `seed.js` (demo data with bcrypt-hashed passwords)

### Phase 3 – Backend API
- 3-tier architecture: Controller → Service → Repository
- Auth: POST `/api/auth/login`, POST `/api/auth/register`
- Leads: full CRUD + GET sorted by score + CSV export
- Tickets: full CRUD with optimistic locking
- Interaction logs: GET + POST per lead
- Dashboard: active leads, open tickets, top 5 leads, monthly revenue
- Users: GET all, PUT role (admin only)

### Phase 4 – Middleware & Security
- `authMiddleware.js`: verifies JWT, attaches `req.user`
- `rbacMiddleware.js`: `allowRoles(...roles)` factory — returns 403 if role insufficient
- Input validation via `express-validator` on auth routes
- All SQL uses parameterised queries

### Phase 5 – Lead Scoring Algorithm
- `scoringService.js`: 5-metric weighted scoring (0–100)
- Metrics: calls (×25), meetings (×25), budget (×20), companySize (×20), emailOpens (×10)
- Score calculated at lead creation time and stored in DB

### Phase 6 – Frontend
- `AuthContext` with JWT decode, login/logout, persisted in `localStorage`
- `api.js` Axios instance: auto-injects `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Protected routing: `ProtectedLayout` + `RoleRoute` in `App.jsx`
- Pages:
  - `LoginPage` — form with `user_email` / `user_password` fields
  - `DashboardPage` — 4 KPI cards with 2-second auto-refresh
  - `LeadPage` — table with create/edit/delete/profile navigation + CSV export button
  - `LeadProfilePage` — unified customer profile: lead info + interaction timeline + linked tickets + admin assignment
  - `TicketPage` — ticket list with create/update (optimistic locking conflict detection)
  - `UsersPage` — admin-only user management with role dropdown
- Components: `NavBar`, `LeadForm`, `TicketForm`, `PriorityTable`
- Responsive layout, minimum viewport 360px

### Phase 7 – Testing
- **18 unit tests** (Jest + mocked repositories): authService, scoringService, ticketService
- **6 functional tests** (Jest + Supertest, live DB): lead CRUD, ticket update, auth 401/403
- **11 BDD scenarios** (Cucumber): lead registration, ticket creation, auth flows, scoring
- All tests passing; results saved to `backend/test_results/`

### Phase 8 – Deployment Configuration
- `render.yaml`: Blueprint defining backend + frontend + PostgreSQL services
- `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example`
- `deployment_info.txt`: step-by-step deployment guide

### Phase 9 – Documentation
- `docs/architecture_description.md`: 3-tier diagram, design decisions, schema
- `docs/user_stories.md`: 14 user stories across 6 epics with READ references
- `docs/acceptance_tests.md`: BDD scenarios mapped to user stories and NFRs
- `docs/implementation_summary.md`: this file
- `README.md`: full technical documentation for public repository

## Known Constraints

- Free Render tier: services spin down after 15 min inactivity (30s cold start)
- JWT expiry is 30 minutes; no refresh token mechanism (scope per READ)
- Scoring recalculated only at creation — editing metrics after creation does not update score (by design)
- Monthly revenue uses `created_at` as the date proxy for Closed leads
